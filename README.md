# Desktop app to facilitate switching profiles
This project is purely an automation tool.
  
Work in progress project. 
  
Currently the goal is to produce a desktop application in python that allows the user to store multiple profiles,.  
Each profile is a name, bio and avatar.  
Do not mistake a profile for an account, although this system is still built to work with multiple accounts, it works on the basis of one logged in at any given time.  
  
These profiles can then be switched easily.
To achieve this functionality a reverse engineered version of Steam's login system is required.  
  
More updates and info soon.
