# Old Branch - Featuring SteamRSA.py
  
Contains two files jsbn.py and SteamRSA.py which are part of an approach that I may return to.  

This branch is currently at the point of producing a successful login when used in a command line environment.  
Our successful login can be seen in the request response headers of the http request sent to Steam's dologin page.  
In order to take advatange of this login, you simply need to store various values returned from the response headers.  

This is a somewhat outdated / unused branch but contains code that may be used in future versions.  
Check the dev or master branches for more up to date info and code.
