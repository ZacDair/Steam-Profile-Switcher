# Desktop app to facilitate switching profiles
This project is purely an automation tool.
  

Currently the goal is to produce a desktop application in python that allows the user to store multiple profiles,.  
Each profile is a name, bio and avatar.
  
These profiles can then be switched easily.
To achieve this functionality a reverse engineered version of Steam's login system is required.  
  
More updates and info soon.
